# DANO-AIRLINE-ANAYLSIS
## Product overview
This capstone project was completed as part of my DIGITALY DRIVE BOOTCAMP ASSESSMENT and focused on analyzing passenger satisfaction data for Dano Airlines. The goal was to understand the key drivers of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction across various services and identify opportunities to enhance the overall passenger experience.  
   DANO airline is a UK-based airline whose headquarter is in London. The latest passenger survey results came in and the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. Analyze satisfaction ratings for different services 
2. Explore the relationship between flight delays, passenger demographics, and satisfaction.  
3. Identify service areas requiring improvement and provide recommendations to increase satisfaction levels.  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
My task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Dano Airlines' satisfaction rate, and present it in the form of a dashboard

## DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset included:  
1)	Passenger Ratings:  Services like Departure and arrival time, ease of online booking, online boarding, leg room services, cleanliness, food and drink, in-flight wife and in- flight entertainment were rated (0-5). While service like baggage handling, in-flight service, seat comfort, on-board service, gate location and check-in service were rated (1-5).

2)	Flight Details: Information on flight distance, departure delays, and arrival delays.  

3)	Demographics: Segments such as returning passengers (106,100,81.69%) and first-time passengers (23,780, 18.3%), travel class, type of travel, gender and age

4)	Satisfaction Levels: Satisfied passenger (73,452, 56.55%), dissatisfied passenger (56,428, 43.45%) 


## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES  
### TOOLS  
	Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and advanced measures.  

### TECHNIQUES 
1. Data Cleaning:  
   - Used unpivoting to reshape the data for analysis.  
   - Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.  

2. Visualization:  
   - Built bar charts, pie charts, line chart and cards to communicate key findings effectively.  
   - Used filters and slicers to allow dynamic exploration of data.  

3. Insights Generation:  
   - Compared satisfaction and dissatisfaction ratings across services and demographic groups.  
   - Examined correlations between delays and satisfaction levels.
